### Technical debt

With the emergence of AI, the initial phase of development has become much easier.
However, the point at which the development speed suddenly drops now comes much earlier.
In the conventional approach, this slowdown used to happen after two or three months,
but with AI, it can occur within just three or four days.
This helps the business side better understand the concept of technical debt.
